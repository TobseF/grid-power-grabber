# âš¡  SR Grid - Power Grabber

 > â„¹ Tool which was used in research in 2015. Now in 2020 it's ready for the GitHub archive.

A simple command line website grabber that reads a single value from a website and stores it in a CSV file.  
It's used to periodically monitor the _[SR Grid Frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_frequency)_ from the 
**Power System Operation Corporation Ltd.** - A Government of India Enterprise.

The parsed websites are:
 * http://www.srldc.org
 * http://www.nrldc.org

I also deployed it to google app engine, but at the end it was enough to run it on a local desktop PC.
